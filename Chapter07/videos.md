#  VIDEOS FOR CHAPTER 7

[Video 1. Fundamentals of Least Squares](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9mF66KpthU) This video covers the fundamental theoretical, practical and metric aspects of the least square fit. It covers determining the best regression model  for the dataset, goodness of fit metrics such as r-squared, adjusted r-squared, rmse, residual plot and  Predicted-Observed (PO) plot analysis.

[Video 2. Linear and Polynomial Regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfrfmDhxdXE) This video covers the implementation of the polynomial regression with a numerical example for linear regression model. The goodness of fit metrics such as r-squared, residual and PO plots, and 68 and 95% confidence intervals are also covered.

[Video 3. Nonlinear (Linearizable) Least Squares Regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG4J4nnjgxk) This video covers transformation techniques to convert complex or nonlinear models to linear models. Numerical solution of an example problem is given step-by-step with emphasis on calculating and assessing the goodness of fit metrics.

[Video 4. Multivariate Regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXTDLgHHwgs) This video covers linear and exponential multivariate regression models. A numerical example, describing how to obtain a multivariate regression model and assess its goodness of fit, has been provided. 

[Video 5. Continuous Least Squares Approximation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGxh6KWnqU4) This video covers practical iimplementational aspects of the continious least squares approximation. An example problem is solved step-by-step.

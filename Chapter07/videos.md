#  VIDEOS FOR CHAPTER 7

[Video 1. Fundamentals of Least Squares](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9mF66KpthU) This video covers the fundamental theoretical, practical and metric aspects of the least square fit. It covers determining the best regression model  for the dataset, goodness of fit metrics such as r-squared, adjusted r-squared, rmse, residual plot and  Predicted-Observed (PO) plot analysis.

[Video 2. Linear and Polynomial Regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfrfmDhxdXE) This video covers the implementation of the polynomial regression with a numerical example for linear regression model. The goodness of fit metrics such as r-squared, residual and PO plots, and 68 and 95% confidence intervals are also covered.

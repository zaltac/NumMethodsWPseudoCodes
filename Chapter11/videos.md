#  VIDEOS FOR CHAPTER 11

[Video 1.Introduction to Eigenvalue Problems and Properties](https://youtu.be/4pE4CtG-2D8) This video covers the concept of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, presents the properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors (i.e., eigenpairs) and Gerschgorin circle theorem to estimate the location and bounds of eigenvalues. An example problem involving a 4x4 matrix is used to illustrate how to estimate the location and bounds of eigenvalues with the Gerschgorin circle theorem.

[Video 2.The Power Method](https://youtu.be/V6vSIifZGZs) This video covers the power method for finding the dominant eigenvalue of a matrix using the method with scaling and also with Rayleigh quotient algorithms. An example problem illustrating the step-by-step implementation of the power method with both scaling and Rayleigh quotient algorithms is presented.

[Video 3.Inverse Power Method](https://youtu.be/Ymv0SXzaJRQ) This video covers the inverse power method in connection with computing the smallest (in magnitude) eigenvalue. An example problem illustrating the step-by-step implementation of the inverse power method is presented.

[Video 4.Shifted Inverse Power Method](https://youtu.be/YjRd8Hrr-0M) This video covers the shifted inverse power method in connection with computing the any eigenvalue of a matrix in the vicinity of a specified value. An example problem illustrating the step-by-step implementation of the shifted inverse power method is presented.

[Video 5.Similarity and Orthogonal Transformations](https://youtu.be/oQiqGDCYOYk) This video covers the properties of similar and orthogonal matrices along with the similarity and orthogonal transformations.

[Video 6.Jacobi Method](https://youtu.be/yIWfeX_XIWg) This video describes the Jacobi method, an iterative method based on orthogonal transformations, to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix. An example problem illustrating the step-by-step implementation of the Jacobi method is presented.

[Video 7.Generalized Eigenvalue Problem](https://youtu.be/qPjVBkhFtY8) This video describes how to transform a generalized eigenvalue problem to a standard edigenvalue problem. Also an algorithm to invert a lower triangular  matrix is given along with an example illustrating the transformation.

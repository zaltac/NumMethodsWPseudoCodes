#  VIDEOS FOR CHAPTER 11

[Video 1.Introduction to Eigenvalue Problems and Properties](https://youtu.be/4pE4CtG-2D8) This video covers the concept of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, presents the properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors (i.e., eigenpairs) and Gerschgorin circle theorem to estimate the location and bounds of eigenvalues. An example problem involving a 4x4 matrix is used to illustrate how to estimate the location and bounds of eigenvalues with the Gerschgorin circle theorem.

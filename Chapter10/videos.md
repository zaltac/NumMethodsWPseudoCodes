#  VIDEOS FOR CHAPTER 10

[Video 1.Introduction to Two-Point Boundary Value Problems](https://youtu.be/WLEWWl_BAuE) This video introduces two-point boundary value problems and all possible boundary conditions (such as Dirichlet, Neumann and Mixed or Robin BCs) that can be applied to such ordinary differential equations.

[Video 2.Finite Difference Solution of Linear Two-Point Boundary Value Problems](https://youtu.be/ZSNcJuuQ1xo) This video covers the steps of numerical solution of a two-point linear boundary value problems subjected to Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundary conditions.  

[Video 3.Finite Difference Solution of Linear Two-Point Boundary Value Problems: Example](https://youtu.be/CxEfX1aF1S8) This video covers the step-by-step finite-difference solution of a two-point boundary value problem.

[Video 4.High-Order Accurate Finite Difference Solutions](https://youtu.be/7R4cFV6AM6c) This video illustrates the complications of the numerical solution of linear two-point boundary value problems using forth-order finite-difference approximations. As an aternative technique, the Richardson extrapolation method is presented and used to solve an example BVP step-by-step.

[Video 5.Use of Non-Uniform Grids](https://youtu.be/m92TRex82s0) This video briefly covers non-uniform grid generation techniques for finite difference implementation of two-point BVPs. The process of transforming ODEs to another domain, where uniform grids can be used is also explained, and a linear two-point BVP example is solved by transforming it to a prescribed domain.

[Video 6.Finite Volume Method for ODEs](https://youtu.be/ycAyynpVyEo) This video covers the finite volume method (for one-dimensional ordinary differential equations) and its step-by-step implementation to second-order two-point linear BVPs.

[Video 7.Finite Volume Method for ODEs: EXAMPLE](https://youtu.be/zhqC-wn-Vss) This video explains the step-by-step solution of a two-point linear boundary value example problem given in conservative form using the finite volume method.

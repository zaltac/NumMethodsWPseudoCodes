#  VIDEOS FOR CHAPTER 10

[Video 1.Introduction to Two-Point Boundary Value Problems](https://youtu.be/WLEWWl_BAuE) This video introduces two-point boundary value problems and all possible boundary conditions (such as Dirichlet, Neumann and Mixed or Robin BCs) that can be applied to such ordinary differential equations.

[Video 2.Finite Difference Solution of Linear Two-Point Boundary Value Problems](https://youtu.be/ZSNcJuuQ1xo) This video covers the steps of numerical solution of a two-point linear boundary value problems subjected to Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundary conditions.  

[Video 3.Finite Difference Solution of Linear Two-Point Boundary Value Problems: Example](https://youtu.be/CxEfX1aF1S8) This video covers the step-by-step finite-difference solution of a two-point boundary value problem.

[Video 4.High-Order Accurate Finite Difference Solutions](https://youtu.be/7R4cFV6AM6c) This video illustrates the complications of the numerical solution of linear two-point boundary value problems using forth-order finite-difference approximations. As an aternative technique, the Richardson extrapolation method is presented and used to solve an example BVP step-by-step.

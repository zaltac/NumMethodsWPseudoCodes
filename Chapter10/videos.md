#  VIDEOS FOR CHAPTER 10

[Video 1.Introduction to Two-Point Boundary Value Problems](https://youtu.be/WLEWWl_BAuE) This video introduces two-point boundary value problems and all possible boundary conditions (such as Dirichlet, Neumann and Mixed or Robin BCs) that can be applied to such ordinary differential equations.

[Video 2.Finite Difference Solution of Linear Two-Point Boundary Value Problems](https://youtu.be/ZSNcJuuQ1xo) This video covers the steps of numerical solution of a two-point linear boundary value problems subjected to Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundary conditions.

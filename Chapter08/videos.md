#  VIDEOS FOR CHAPTER 8

[Video 1. Trapezoidal Rule with and without End Correction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7obHkHiTyTM) This video covers the trapezoidal rule for numerical integration. The numerical formulas with and without the end correction have been presented with error assessment means. A numerical example is presented showing the step-by-step solution and assessing the accuracy of the estimates.

[Video 2. Simpson's Rule with and without End Correction](https://youtu.be/sMswAjyNZz0) This video covers simpson's 1/3 and 3/8 rules, and Simpson's 1/3 rule with end correction. The presented numerical integration example includes the implementation of Simpson's rule for the even and odd panel number cases, as well as the calculation of the upper bound for the global error.

[Video 3. Romberg's Rule](https://youtube.com/video/4EIfPGYe3L8/) This video covers the theoretical and practval aspects of the Romberg's rule. A numerical example problem is solved step by step.

[Video 4. Adaptive Integration](https://youtu.be/bDPjUDB9m9s) This video covers the theoretical and practical aspects of adaptive Simpson's 1/3 rule. The solution of an example integral problem is illustrated step by step.

[Video 5. Newton-Cotes Integration](https://youtu.be/EbT8k_gU5dM) This video deals with the closed and open Newton-Cotes rules. However, this lecture is largely devoted to closed Newton-Cotes rules. It provides step-by-step solution of an itegral with an endpoint singularity.

[Video 6. Integration of Nonuniformly Spaced Discrete Functions](https://youtu.be/41FAic-ZOjw) This video covers numerical integration of nonuniformly spaced discrete datasets using variants of the trapezoidal and simpsons's rules.

[Video 7. Gauss-Legendre Method](https://youtu.be/0ZqziMFom6U) This video covers the Gauss-Legendre method as a numerical method for integrating explicitly given functions. Legendre polynomials, their recurrence relations, along with the numerical computation of the Gauss-Legendre quadratures. An example is presented explaining the step-by-step solution process with this method.

[Video 8. Computing Improper Integrals](https://youtu.be/Fftq-DSoaD0) This video covers the computation of Type I (integrals with infinite limits) and Type II (integrals with singularities) improper integrals. Avoiding improper integrals by coordinate transformation, truncating the integrals, subtraction of singularity, ignoring the singularity, techniques are presented and illustrated with examples.

[Video 9. Gauss-Laguerre Method and Gauss-Laguerre Quadrature](https://youtu.be/_54xFHDDOGo) This video describes the Gauss-Laguerre method, along with Laguerre polynomials and generating the Gauss-Laguerre quadrature set. An example problem is also presented, with a step-by-step solution.

[Video 10. Gauss-Hermite Method and Gauss-Hermite Quadrature](https://youtu.be/hoCFDnR4XuU) This video describes the Gauss-Hermite method, along with Hermite polynomials and generating the Gauss-Hermite quadrature set. An example problem is also presented, with a step-by-step solution.

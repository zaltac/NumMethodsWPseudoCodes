#  VIDEOS FOR CHAPTER 8

[Video 1. Trapezoidal Rule with and without End Correction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7obHkHiTyTM) This video covers the trapezoidal rule for numerical integration. The numerical formulas with and without the end correction have been presented with error assessment means. A numerical example is presented showing the step-by-step solution and assessing the accuracy of the estimates.

[Video 2. Simpson's Rule with and without End Correction](https://youtu.be/sMswAjyNZz0) This video covers simpson's 1/3 and 3/8 rules, and Simpson's 1/3 rule with end correction. The presented numerical integration example includes the implementation of Simpson's rule for the even and odd panel number cases, as well as the calculation of the upper bound for the global error.

[Video 3. Romberg's Rule](https://youtube.com/video/4EIfPGYe3L8/) This video covers the theoretical and practval aspects of the Romberg's rule. A numerical example problem is solved step by step.

[Video 4. Adaptive Integration](https://youtu.be/bDPjUDB9m9s) This video covers the theoretical and practical aspects of adaptive Simpson's 1/3 rule. The solution of an example integral problem is illustrated step by step.

[Video 5. Newton-Cotes Integration](https://youtu.be/EbT8k_gU5dM) This video deals with the closed and open Newton-Cotes rules. However, this lecture is largely devoted to closed Newton-Cotes rules. It provides step-by-step solution of an itegral with an endpoint singularity.

[Video 6. Integration of Nonuniformly Spaced Discrete Functions](https://youtu.be/41FAic-ZOjw) This video covers numerical integration of nonuniformly spaced discrete datasets using variants of the trapezoidal and simpsons's rules.

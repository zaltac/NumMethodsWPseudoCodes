#  VIDEOS FOR CHAPTER 9

[Video 1. Fundamental Initial Value Problem](https://youtu.be/wturVK8IdkE) This video explains the fundamental initial value problem (IVP), types of initial value problems as first-, second- and high-order ODEs. The classification as linear and non-linear problems are explained with practical examples. In the text and video series, it is also explained as to why the methods are generally illustrated using the first-order IVP as a model.

[Video 2. One Step Methods: Explicit Euler Method](https://youtu.be/LKAEhh0-oj8) This video covers the explicit Euler method, its discretization, and the solution algorithm. An illustrative example is solved step-by-step and the results are discussed for varying h.

[Video 3. One Step Methods: Method of Taylor Polynomial](https://youtu.be/3UKCFFHYwPU) This video describes the taylor polynomial approximation for solving initial value problems. A step-by-step solution of an example problem is presented.

[Video 4. One Step Methods: Implicit and Linearized Euler Methods](https://youtu.be/1vpJoTgDHCk) This video covers the implicit Euler and linearized implicit Euler methods for solving the intial value problems. An example that illustrates the application of the method is presented step-by-step.

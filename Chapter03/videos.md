#  VIDEOS FOR CHAPTER 3

[Video 1. Basic Concepts of Iterative Methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWaBijUQsTA) Basics concepts of iterative methods such as iteration steps (initialization, computation, termination) are covered. Stopping or termination criteria are introduced. Error sources are summarized.

[Video 2. Jacobi Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xik0_MWTW64) This video covers Jacobi method for obtaining the approximate solution of linear system of equations. A 3x3 linear system is used to illustrate the step by step solution with the method.

[Video 3. Gauss-Seidel and SOR Methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0X8mcX6HMKs) In this video, the Gauss-Seidel and Successive Over Relaxation methods are presented with their advantages and disadvantages. The methods are cemented with a numerical example.

[Video 4. Stationary Iterative Methods: Convergence Issues and Convergence Rates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLsMSw28AnY) This video deals with the convergence properties and convergence rates of Stationary Iterative Methods, such as Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and the SOR methods. An illustrative numerical example is provided.

[Video 5. The Krylov Space Methods -- Conjugate Gradient Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BTVIh-1Uxk) This video covers the basic Conjugate Gradient Method for symmetric linear systems. It is illustrated with a numerical example (a system of 4x4 equations). The convergence issues as well as two algorithms ( Conjugate Gradient Normal Residual method and Conjugate Gradient Normal Error Method) for non-symmetric systems are presented.

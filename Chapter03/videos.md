#  VIDEOS FOR CHAPTER 3

[Video 1. Basic Concepts of Iterative Methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWaBijUQsTA) Basics concepts of iterative methods such as iteration steps (initialization, computation, termination) are covered. Stopping or termination criteria are introduced. Error sources are summarized.

[Video 2. Jacobi Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xik0_MWTW64) This video covers Jacobi method for obtaining the approximate solution of linear system of equations. A 3x3 linear system is used to illustrate the step by step solution with the method.

[Video 3. Gauss-Seidel and SOR Methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0X8mcX6HMKs) In this video, the Gauss-Seidel and Successive Over Relaxation methods are presented with their advantages and disadvantages. The methods are cemented with a numerical example.

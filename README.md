Dear Visitor,

This book has been prepared to provide extra support materials to students and instructors who will make use of the text "NUMERICAL METHODS FOR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS: With Pseudocodes." CRC Press, 2024.
This site will be active when the book goes on sale and becomes available for instructor evaluations sometime in October 2024. 
The site will contain C, C++, Fortran, Python, VB, Matlab, and Mathemtica codes that correspond to the modules presented in the book. 
I plan to mature the site over time by including comprehension questions, extra-solved problems, teaching videos, and more. 
I am hoping that the course instructors can make efficient use of these materials in their courses.

Prof. Zekeriya ALTAÇ

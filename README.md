Dear Visitor,

This book has been prepared to provide extra support materials for students and instructors who make use of the text [NUMERICAL METHODS FOR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS: WITH PSEUDOCODES. CRC Press, 2024](https://www.routledge.com/Numerical-Methods-for-Scientists-and-Engineers-With-Pseudocodes/Altac/p/book/9781032754741).

This site will be fully active when the book goes on sale and becomes available for instructor evaluations on October 15, 2024. 
The site will contain C, C++, Fortran, Python, VB, Matlab, and Mathemtica codes that correspond to some of the pseudocodes presented in the book. 
As a sample, I have posted some materials for Chapter 1 to give you an idea and advanced preview of what you may find on this site. 
I plan to mature the site over time by including teaching videos, quizzes, and so on. 
I am hoping that the course instructors can make efficient use of these materials in their teaching.

Prof. Zekeriya ALTAÇ

Dear Visitor,

This site will be active when the book goes on sale and becomes available for instructor evaluations. 
The site will contain C, C++, Fortran, Python, VB, Matlab, and Mathemtica codes that correspond to the modules presented in the book. 
I plan to mature the site over time by including comprehension questions, extra-solved problems, teaching videos, and more. 
I am hoping that the course instructors can make efficient use of these materials in their courses.

Dear Visitor,

This book has been prepared to provide extra support materials for students and instructors who make use of the text [NUMERICAL METHODS FOR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS: WITH PSEUDOCODES. CRC Press, 2024](https://www.routledge.com/Numerical-Methods-for-Scientists-and-Engineers-With-Pseudocodes/Altac/p/book/9781032754741).

The site will contain C, C++, Fortran, Python, VB, Matlab, and Mathemtica codes that correspond to some of the pseudocodes presented in the book. 
As a preview, I have posted the materials for **Chapter 1** to give you an idea what you may find on this site. I plan to mature the site over time by including additional teaching videos, codes, quizzes, and so on. I hope that the course instructors can make efficient use of these materials in their teaching. This site will be fully ready and active by **April 15, 2025**. 

For instructors, the following video provides information about the learning objectives, teaching strategies, and supplementary materials that will accompany the book:

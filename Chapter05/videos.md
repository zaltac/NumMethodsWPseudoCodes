#  VIDEOS FOR CHAPTER 5

[Video 1. Numerical Differentiation Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1E7Wo-Bn-0) In this video, the numerical differentiation and its geometric interpretation are presented. The necessity for numerical differentiation, truncation, and round-off errors is explained. First-order forward and backward, along with the second-order central difference, formulas are derived.

[Video 2. Examples of Numerical Differentiation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM2jNF5M8nA) In this video, two examples are presented. The first one involves differentiating an explicitly known function illustrating the effect of reducing h on forward and central difference formulas. The second example involves a discrete dataset for which first and second derivatives are estimated using second-order difference formulas.
